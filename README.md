# Practice React By Making A Movie app

This project won't work unless you provide it with your own REACT_APP_API_KEY which is a key from The Movie Database (TMDB) and you can get one for free
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## In this project, I learnt :

- React
- JSX
- Styled Components
- React Router
- State and Props
- Context
- CSS
- API handling
- Hooks
- Persist state in SessionStorage
- Deploy to Netlify
- And MUCH more ...

## Steps I followed :

1. Bootstrap with CRA
2. Install dependencies
3. Setup API Key
4. Global Styles
5. Header Component
6. Header Component - Styles
7. Home Component
8. Fetch data from the API for Home Page
9. Custom hook for Home Page
10. HeroImage Component
11. HeroImage Component - Styles
12. Grid Component
13. Grid Component - Styles
14. Thumb Component
15. Thumb Component - Styles
16. Spinner Component
17. SearchBar Component
18. SearchBar Component - Styles
19. SearchBar Component - Logic
20. Button Component
21. Button Component - Styles
22. Button Component - Logic
23. Short about React Router
24. Routing with React Router
25. Movie Component - Scaffold
26. Fetch movie data from the API
27. BreadCrumb Component
28. BreadCrumb Component - Styles
29. MovieInfo Component
30. MovieInfo Component - Styles
31. MovieInfoBar Component
32. MovieInfoBar Component - Styles
33. Actor Component
34. Actor Component - Styles
35. Validate Props with PropTypes
36. SessionStorage - Home
37. SessionStorage - Movie

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
